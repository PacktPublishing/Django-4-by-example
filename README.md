## About the Book

**Django 4 by Example** (4th edition) will guide you through the entire process of developing professional web applications with Django. The book not only covers the most relevant aspects of the framework, but it will also teach you how to integrate other popular technologies into your Django projects.

The book will walk you through the creation of four real-world applications, solving common problems, and implementing best practices, using a step-by-step approach that is easy to follow.

After reading this book, you will have a good understanding of how Django works and how to build practical, advanced web applications.

## Django Projects

You’ll cover a wide range of web app development topics as you build four different apps:

- **Blog Application**: Create a complete blog application using Django. Create data models, views, and URLs and implement an admin site for your blog. Create sitemaps and RSS feeds and implement a full-text search engine with PostgreSQL. Build a tagging system using [django-taggit](https://github.com/jazzband/django-taggit).

- **Social Website**: Implement authentication with Facebook, Twitter, and Google using [Python Social Auth](https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django). Create user profiles, image thumbnails with [easy-thumbnails](https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails), build a JavaScript bookmarklet, create an activity stream, implement a user follow system and add infinite scroll pagination using Django and JavaScript.

- **Ecommerce Application**: Build a product catalog, a shopping cart, and asynchronous tasks with [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/). Process payments with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and manage payment notifications via webhooks. Generate PDF invoices using [Weasyprint](https://weasyprint.org/) and export orders to CSV.

- **eLearning Platform**: Create a content management system that manages users, groups, and permissions. Build a REST API using [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and implement a real-time chat using WebSockets and Django Channels. Create a production environment using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Daphne](https://github.com/django/daphne).

## Code Snippets for Intermediate Steps
[Work in progress] Main Chapter folders contain only the finished code for each chapter. Additional folders contain the files as they appear for a
given stage of each chapter.

Where there are interim files for the chapter, you can find those files in the `chXX` folder within a sub-folder for each section. Where the edit to a particular file brings it in line with the final version, that file is not included in the interim tree.

Changed lines are marked with a comment. Where an entire block is new or changed, there is a hashtag on the line following the end of changed lines.

Filenames like `filename_00.py` are the auto-generated files before any edits are applied, they exist for informational purposes only.
